# mutilated-chessboard
 - A python program allowing for the visualisation of all possible ways of chopping up a chessboard given set constraints.

 - Uses OOP to define a chessboard as a class with variable side length, with methods including those of removing a square and sticking them back in.

 - Allows for alternative interpretation as an array to ease with implementation of methods such as looking at squares above and below the current square.

 - Prints to terminal all possible combinations of mutilating a chessboard, as per the brief.

 - Note a 1 denotes a square has been removed, and a 0 indicates a square has been left in.

- Input : side length 
- Output: diagrams of how to mutilate the chessboard
